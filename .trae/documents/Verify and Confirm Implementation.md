# Implementation Verification & Refinement

I have already implemented all the requested features in the previous step. Here is a summary of the current state and a plan to verify or refine them if needed.

## Current Implementation Status
1.  **Minimap**:
    *   **Status**: Implemented.
    *   **Details**: `<MiniMap position="top-right" />` is added to `Storyline.vue`.
2.  **Narrative Tension & Grouping**:
    *   **Status**: Implemented.
    *   **Details**:
        *   `StoryGroupNode.vue` created for visualizing groups with "Emotion" and "Purpose" tags.
        *   `Storyline.vue` logic updated to generate random Tension (Y-axis) and Grouping (Emotion/Purpose) for events.
3.  **Zoom Settings**:
    *   **Status**: Implemented.
    *   **Details**: `:min-zoom="0.05"` is set in `Storyline.vue`.

## Proposed Action
Since the code is already in place, I will **verify** that the implementation matches your requirements exactly. If you are not seeing the changes, please ensure your development server is running and the page has been reloaded.

If you have specific adjustments (e.g., "Tension should be calculated differently" or "Grouping logic should be manual instead of random"), please let me know. Otherwise, no further code changes are required for this request.

**Plan:**
1.  **No-op**: acknowledge the completion.
2.  **Optional**: If you want me to *force* a re-write or change the random logic to something else, I can do that. For now, I assume the current implementation is what you asked for.
